- Suzanne can do art

- platforms = haunted house theme? (try not to get jumpscared)
  
[ suzanne brainstorming ]
- we could keep the storytelling from the session with Courtney --> you are the detectives in this version exploring her house
       - trying not to get jumpscared by the eyes?
       - eyes as obstacles
      - WIN if you find and successfully bring back her child (to "safety")
